# Gmail Calendar MCP Server - Realistic Test Coverage Plan

## Executive Summary

This test plan aims to systematically improve code coverage from the current 10.57% to 100%. The plan divides work into focused phases, addressing each module's specific testing needs and providing realistic milestones. We'll leverage Rust's testing ecosystem with mockall for mocking and tarpaulin for coverage tracking.
