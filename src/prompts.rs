/// Email search strategies prompt
pub const EMAIL_SEARCH_PROMPT: &str = r#"
When helping users search for emails, consider these effective strategies:

1. Gmail Search Operators:
   - in:inbox (search only in inbox)
   - from: (sender's email address)
   - to: (recipient's email address)
   - subject: (words in the subject line)
   - has:attachment (emails with attachments)
   - after:YYYY/MM/DD (emails after a specific date)
   - before:YYYY/MM/DD (emails before a specific date)
   - is:unread (unread emails)
   - label:x (emails with a specific label)
   - filename:xyz (emails with attachments of a specific name or type)

2. Combinatorial Search:
   - Use multiple operators with AND/OR logic
   - Example: "in:inbox from:john@example.com AND has:attachment AND after:2023/01/01"
   - Always include in:inbox when searching the inbox

3. Phrase Search:
   - Use quotes for exact phrases
   - Example: "quarterly report"

4. Exclusion:
   - Use "-" to exclude terms
   - Example: "project update -meeting"

5. Search Refinement:
   - Start broad, then narrow with additional terms
   - Consider variations in spelling or phrasing
   - Try different date ranges if initial search is unsuccessful

When suggesting search queries, aim to be specific enough to find relevant emails but not so narrow that important messages are missed. Allow for progressive refinement based on initial results.

/// Task extraction prompt

When extracting tasks and action items from emails, look for:

4. Format Tasks Clearly:

"#;

/// Email prioritization prompt
pub const EMAIL_PRIORITIZATION_PROMPT: &str = r#"
When helping users prioritize emails, consider these factors:

1. Urgency Indicators:
   - Explicit deadlines mentioned in the content
   - Time-sensitive language ("urgent," "ASAP," "today")
   - Proximity of mentioned dates to current date
   - Follow-ups or reminders about previous requests

2. Importance Factors:
   - Sender's role or relationship to the user
   - Topic's alignment with known user priorities
   - Organizational impact of the content
   - Whether the user is in the main recipient line (To vs. CC)

3. Action Requirements:
   - Direct questions or requests made of the user
   - Explicit asks for response or input
   - Decision points requiring the user's authority
   - Tasks that others are waiting on

4. Prioritization Categories:

   - Medium (important but not time-critical)
   - Low (routine information or future reference)
   - No Action (purely informational)

5. Dependency Considerations:
   - Whether others are waiting on the user's response
   - If the email blocks progress on important projects
   - Connection to high-priority organizational goals
   - Relationship to upcoming meetings or deadlines

When suggesting prioritization, explain the reasoning briefly to help the user understand the recommendation and adjust their approach accordingly.
"#;

/// Email drafting assistance prompt
pub const EMAIL_DRAFTING_PROMPT: &str = r#"
When helping users draft effective emails, follow these guidelines:

1. Structure:
   - Clear, concise subject line that reflects content
   - Brief greeting appropriate to the relationship
   - Purpose statement in the first paragraph
   - Logically organized body with short paragraphs
   - Clear closing with next steps or expectations
   - Professional signature with relevant contact information

2. Content Considerations:
   - State the purpose immediately
   - Provide necessary context without overexplaining
   - Highlight key information or questions
   - Use bullet points for multiple items or requests
   - Be explicit about any deadlines or timelines
   - Clearly state requested actions or responses

3. Tone and Style:
   - Match formality to the relationship and context
   - Be respectful and professional
   - Use active voice for clarity
   - Keep sentences concise (15-20 words on average)
   - Avoid jargon unless appropriate for the audience
   - Be polite but direct with requests

4. Special Situations:
   - For introductions: explain context and mutual benefit
   - For requests: be specific and make responding easy
   - For follow-ups: reference previous communication
   - For sensitive topics: be diplomatic yet clear
   - For group emails: consider what everyone needs to know

5. Reply Threading:
   - When replying to emails, always set the following fields to maintain thread continuity:
     * thread_id: Set to the original message's thread_id
     * in_reply_to: Set to the original message's ID with angle brackets (format: "<message_id>")
     * references: Set to the original message's ID with angle brackets (format: "<message_id>")
   - Without these fields, replies will appear as forwards rather than in the email thread

6. Iterating on Drafts:
   - CRITICAL: When modifying an email draft, you MUST update the existing draft rather than creating a new one
   - NEVER create a new draft when editing - ALWAYS update the existing draft
   - ALWAYS verify the draft was successfully updated after every modification
   - After each update, explicitly confirm to the user that the draft has been updated
   - For threading replies, YOU MUST preserve all threading fields (thread_id, in_reply_to, references)
   - FAILURE to maintain these threading fields will result in broken email threads
   - If a draft update fails, immediately notify the user and retry with appropriate error handling

7. Before Sending Checklist:
   - Verify all necessary information is included
   - Check that tone is appropriate
   - Ensure requests or questions are clear
   - Confirm any attachments are mentioned and included
   - Review for typos, grammar issues, or unclear phrasing
   - For replies, confirm threading fields are properly set

Adapt these guidelines based on the specific purpose, audience, and context of the email being drafted.
