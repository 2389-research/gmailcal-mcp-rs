## Phase Progress

### Phase 1: Existing High-Coverage Modules Completion

- [x] Config Module Testing (1.1) - Target: 100% (Fixed failing tests)
- [x] Utils Module Testing (1.2) - Target: 100% (Added targeted tests for remaining uncovered lines)
- [x] Logging Module Testing (1.3) - Target: 100% (Added tests for file path determination and header writing)

### Phase 2: Moderate-Coverage Module Enhancement

- [ ] Auth Module Enhancement (2.1) - Target: 100%

### Phase 3: Zero-Coverage Critical API Modules

- [ ] Gmail API Testing (3.1) - Target: 95%
- [ ] Calendar API Testing (3.2) - Target: 95%
- [ ] People API Testing (3.3) - Target: 95%

### Phase 4: Infrastructure and Complex Modules

- [ ] OAuth Module Testing (4.1) - Target: 95%
- [ ] Error Handling Testing (4.2) - Target: 100%

### Phase 5: Server and Integration

- [ ] Server Module Testing (5.1) - Target: 90%
- [ ] Main Function Testing (5.2) - Target: 95%

### Phase 6: Advanced Testing Techniques

- [ ] Property-Based Testing (6.1) - In progress
- [ ] Performance Benchmarking (6.2) - In progress

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1

#### Config Module Testing (1.1)
- Existing tests in config_tests.rs and config_module_tests.rs
- Needs additional tests for dotenv integration and edge cases

#### Utils Module Testing (1.2)
- Extensive tests already in utils_module_tests.rs
- Added utils_extended_tests.rs for additional coverage
- Created utils_line_targeting_tests.rs to catch specific edge cases
- Created utils_final_coverage_tests.rs to achieve 100% coverage
- Specifically targeted test coverage for lines 59, 138, and 201
- All error handling paths now fully covered

#### Logging Module Testing (1.3)
- Existing tests in logging_module_tests.rs
- Created logging_final_coverage_tests.rs to achieve 100% coverage
- Specifically targeted test coverage for lines 51, 53, 62-63, and 65
- Tested log file path determination logic
- Tested log file header writing
- Created combined test to verify complete logging functionality

### Phase 2

#### Auth Module Enhancement (2.1)
- Existing tests in auth_module_tests.rs and token_refresh_tests.rs
- Need to expand token expiry testing and error scenarios

### Phase 3

#### Gmail API Testing (3.1)
- Existing tests in gmail_api_tests.rs and gmail_message_tests.rs
- Need comprehensive tests for all API operations

#### Calendar API Testing (3.2)
- Existing skeleton in calendar_api_tests.rs
- Need to implement full test coverage for API operations

#### People API Testing (3.3)
- Existing framework in people_api_tests.rs
- Need to expand test cases for all API functions

### Phase 6

#### Property-Based Testing (6.1)
- Initial property tests implemented in property_tests.rs
- Need to expand to cover more data structures

#### Performance Benchmarking (6.2)
- Initial benchmarks set up in benches/benchmarks.rs
- Need to add benchmarks for all critical operations
