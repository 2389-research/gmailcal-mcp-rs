# Test Implementation Plan - Progress Report

This document outlines the progress made in implementing a comprehensive test suite for the Gmail MCP Server project.

## Achievements

1. **Structured Test Framework**
   - Created a well-organized test suite with dedicated test files for each component
   - Implemented placeholder tests that can be filled in with actual implementation details
   - Ensured all tests compile and run successfully

2. **New Test Modules Added**
   - `token_gmail_tests.rs` - Tests for token management
   - `error_tests.rs` - Tests for error handling
   - `calendar_api_tests.rs` - Tests for Calendar API
   - `gmail_message_tests.rs` - Tests for email message parsing
   - `gmail_draft_tests.rs` - Tests for draft emails
   - `people_api_tests.rs` - Tests for People API
   - `server_tests.rs` - Tests for MCP server functionality

3. **Test Documentation**
   - Updated `TESTS.md` with comprehensive documentation
   - Added a clear structure for tracking implemented and needed tests
   - Included instructions for running tests and measuring coverage

4. **Test Coverage Expanded**
   - Increased the total number of test cases from ~12 to ~31
   - Covered more components of the system, including previously untested ones
   - Added tests for error handling, a critical part of robust code

## Remaining Work

1. **Flesh Out Placeholder Tests**
   - Many tests are currently placeholders that compile but don't fully test functionality
   - Need to integrate with the actual implementation details
   - Add assertions that verify correct behavior

2. **Add Mock HTTP Client**
   - Implement proper HTTP client mocking with mockall
   - Mock API responses to test without real network calls
   - Test error handling and edge cases

3. **Improve Test Coverage**
   - Identify and add tests for uncovered code paths
   - Focus on error handling and edge cases
   - Add more thorough validation of outputs

4. **Test Code Quality**
   - Fix warnings and improve test code quality
   - Add proper documentation for all test functions
   - Follow Rust best practices for testing

5. **Set Up CI/CD**
   - Implement continuous integration with GitHub Actions
   - Add code coverage reporting
   - Add code quality checks

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize the remaining test implementations based on critical functionality
2. Set up code coverage tools to identify untested code
3. Fix existing test warnings to improve code quality
4. Gradually fill in placeholder tests with actual implementation details

## Measuring Success

Success criteria for the test suite:
- Code coverage exceeding 80%
- All critical paths tested
- All error conditions covered
- Tests that are maintainable and easily extended

## Resources Required

- Time to understand the implementation details
- Knowledge of mockall for mocking HTTP clients
- Understanding of test patterns in Rust
- Setup of code coverage tools
